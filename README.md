# Employee-Management-System-CSCI207-Data-Structures-Aglorithms
This project has several parts and involves implementing a program to manage a list of employees using object-oriented programming and a singly linked list.

Part #1 involves creating a base class called Employee with private attributes including Full_Name, Email, Phone, Position, and Salary, and implementing methods to display employee information, as well as getters and setters for all attributes.

Part #2 requires creating a singly linked list of type Employee using generics and implementing methods to insert, edit, delete, and print employees in the system. The insert method checks if an employee already exists with the same email, and the edit and delete methods use the email as a parameter.

Part #3 involves creating a menu-driven program with options to insert a new employee, edit an employee's salary, delete an employee, print all employees, and close the program.

Part #4 is a bonus part that involves implementing a method to update any one of the attributes of an employee, which takes the email as a parameter and prompts the user for which attribute they want to change.

Overall, this project involves implementing object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation, as well as data structures such as linked lists and generics.
